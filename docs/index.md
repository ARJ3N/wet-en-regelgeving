# Back to the future Ipsum
When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Perfect, just perfect. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Over there, on my hope chest. I’ve never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don’t know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don’t know how to do it. George. George. Weight has nothing to do with it. I know, and all I could say is I’m sorry. I can’t believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could’ve been killed.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don’t want her to worry about you. You okay, is everything alright? Can’t be. This is nuts. Aw, c’mon. I’m too loud. I can’t believe it. I’m never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother’s hair. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn’t run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Biff. I will. Oh.

Did you hurt your head? Okay, alright, I’ll prove it to you. Look at my driver’s license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven’t even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Oh. Actually, people call me Marty. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Ohh, no. There’s that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth’s gravitational pull? What a nightmare. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I’ll throw the rope down to you.

Science Fiction Theater. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I’m wearing? Aw yeah, everything is great. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

Hi, it’s really a pleasure to meet you. We never would have fallen in love. Flux capacitor. Uh, Doc. Excuse me.

This is for all you lovers out there. Stop it. Yeah Mom, we know, you’ve told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? He’s your brother, Mom.

Yeah Mom, we know, you’ve told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Yeah well, you shouldn’t drink. What’s the meaning of this. Jesus, George, it’s a wonder I was ever born. Who?
